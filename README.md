## Development

```sh
npm i
cp .env.template .env
npm run server:cli db:init
npm run server:cli db:seed
npm run dev
```

## Compodoc Documents

```sh
npm run doc:client:build
npm run doc:client:serve
```

```sh
npm run doc:server:build
npm run doc:server:serve
```

## Deployment

### Local Deployment

```sh
cp .env.template .env
docker compose up
```

### Azure App Service Deployment

See `/.azure`.

### PWA and HTTPS

PWA features require a HTTPS context.

It's never a good practice to configure SSL stuff at the app scope. When deploying apps to the cloud, HTTPS usually automatically enabled, but when deploying locally, you'll need a outer server to enable HTTPS for the inner server running within docker.
