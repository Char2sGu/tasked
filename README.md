### Building the Image behind a Proxy

Before `docker compose up` or `docker compose build`, create `docker-compose.override.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  client:
    build:
      args:
        - HTTP_PROXY=http://host.docker.internal:10809
        - HTTPS_PROXY=http://host.docker.internal:10809
  server:
    build:
      args:
        - HTTP_PROXY=http://host.docker.internal:10809
        - HTTPS_PROXY=http://host.docker.internal:10809
```

### PWA(HTTPS)

PWA features require a HTTPS context.

It is always **recommended** to have a server running outside the container and configure a reverse proxy toward the server running inside the container. But when using HTTPS, this becomes **required** to do so, since it is not a good practice to configure SSL certificates in the App scope.
