## Development

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TheNightmareX/tasked
```

Docker is used for deployment only. For development, Node.js 15 or other compatible version of Node.js need to be installed.

For further instructions, see README of the submodules.

## Deployment

1. Get the resources:
   ```sh
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/TheNightmareX/tasked
   ```
1. Create and edit `.env` files to configure the application:
   ```sh
   cp tasked-backend/.env.template tasked-backend/.env
   ```
1. Prepare a domain and its corresponding SSL certificate (**fullchain.pem** and **privkey.pem** are required):
   ```sh
   cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.app/ tasked-frontend/.docker/cert/
   ```
1. Optionally configure Docker Compose via a overriding file:
   ```sh
   touch docker-compose.override.yaml
   ```
1. Build and launch the application via Docker:
   ```sh
   docker compose up;
   ```

### Installing Dependencies behind a Proxy

Create `docker-compose.override.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    build:
      args:
        - HTTP_PROXY=http://host.docker.internal:10809
        - HTTPS_PROXY=http://host.docker.internal:10809
  frontend:
    build:
      args:
        - HTTP_PROXY=http://host.docker.internal:10809
        - HTTPS_PROXY=http://host.docker.internal:10809
```
